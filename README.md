# AutoDesk AI

A cross-platform desktop application where autonomous AI agent teams handle the full software development lifecycle — planning, coding, reviewing, and testing — while humans approve plans and deployments only.

**Motto: 99% agent-driven. Humans approve, deploy, and communicate.**

## Overview

AutoDesk AI manages software development projects through a team of specialized AI agents orchestrated by a Project Manager (PM) agent. The PM talks to the user, creates plans, spawns sub-agents, and manages a kanban board. Write agents (backend engineer, frontend engineer, etc.) execute one at a time; read-only agents can run in parallel.

**Core workflow:**

1. User describes a task in chat
2. PM creates a plan → user approves
3. PM creates kanban tasks and dispatches specialist agents
4. Agents write code, commit to a feature branch, move tasks through the board
5. Code reviewer auto-spawns when a task reaches the "review" column
6. Completed work is summarized back to the user

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Desktop framework | [Electrobun](https://electrobun.dev) 1.15.1 (Bun runtime + native WebView2) |
| Frontend | React 19, TanStack Router, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI |
| Backend | Bun (TypeScript), Drizzle ORM |
| Database | SQLite (WAL mode) |
| AI SDK | Vercel AI SDK (`ai` ^6.0) — provider-agnostic |
| Build | Vite (frontend) + Electrobun build (app bundle) |

---

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) — runtime and package manager
- Windows 11 (WebView2 is included) or macOS / Linux with compatible WebView
- At least one AI provider API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, etc.)
- Git (for agent git operations)

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd autodesk
bun install
```

---

## Running

**Development (recommended):**
```bash
bun run dev
```
Starts Electrobun in watch mode with Vite production build. Rebuilds on file changes.

**HMR mode (faster iteration on frontend):**
```bash
bun run dev:fast
```
Runs Vite dev server on port 5173 alongside Electrobun. Frontend hot-reloads without full rebuild.

**Windows — use the PowerShell launcher** (sets required env vars including WebView2 remote debugging port):
```powershell
.\run.ps1
```

> `run.ps1` sets `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS=--remote-debugging-port=9222` which enables CDP-based browser testing via the chrome-devtools MCP.

---

## Building

```bash
bun run build
```

Produces a distributable app bundle in `build/`.

```bash
bun run build:canary
```

Canary build variant.

## How It Works

### Agent Execution

- The **Project Manager** is the sole orchestrator. It handles planning, task creation, and dispatching sub-agents.
- Sub-agents run **inline** in the main conversation — their tool calls are visible as message cards in the chat.
- **One write-agent at a time**: a `writeAgentRunning` boolean guard in PM tools prevents concurrent write operations.
- **Read-only agents** (`code-explorer`, `research-expert`, `task-planner`) can run in parallel via `run_agents_parallel`.

### Plan → Approve → Execute

1. PM calls `request_plan_approval` → plan card shown in chat
2. User replies "approve"
3. PM calls `create_tasks_from_plan` → kanban tasks created
4. PM calls `run_agent` to dispatch specialist agents one at a time

### Kanban Flow

```
backlog → working → review → done
```

- `backlog`: created by PM via `create_tasks_from_plan`
- `working`: agent claims task via `move_task`
- `review`: agent finishes and moves task; code-reviewer auto-spawns
- `done`: review-cycle moves task after `submit_review(approved)`

### Agent Sessions

When the same agent type is re-dispatched in a conversation, it resumes its **persistent session** — it remembers prior work, design decisions, and tool results. Sessions are stored in SQLite and survive app restarts. Sessions auto-summarize at ~40k tokens.

### Feature Branch Workflow

PM calls `set_feature_branch` before dispatching write agents. Agents commit to this branch; the PM can create a pull request when the feature is complete.

### Context Window Management

Agent loops track context usage (`lastPromptTokens / getContextLimit(modelId)`). Progressive compaction kicks in at 60/70/85/90% usage. Agents run until the task is complete — there is no iteration cap.

## AI Providers

Supported out of the box (configure API keys in Settings › Providers):

| Provider | Models |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | Claude 4.x, Claude 3.x |
| OpenAI | GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini, etc. |
| Google Gemini | Gemini 2.x, 1.5 |
| DeepSeek | DeepSeek V3, R1 |
| Groq | Llama 3.x, Mixtral |
| xAI Grok | Grok 3 |
| OpenRouter | Any model via OpenRouter |
| Ollama | Any locally running model |

---

## External Channels

Agents and users can communicate via:

- **Discord** — bot connects to a server; agents can post updates and receive commands
- **WhatsApp** — via Baileys library; QR-code pairing
- **Email** — IMAP (receive) + SMTP (send) via nodemailer

Configure under Settings › Channels.

---

## Skills System

Skills extend what agents can do. A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions.

Skills are **filesystem-only** — never stored in the database. Two locations:

- **Built-in**: `skills/` in the project root (copied into app bundle)
- **User**: `{userData}/skills/` — editable outside the app

Skills are compatible with the Claude Code / Agent Skills open standard.

```
skills/
└── my-skill/
    └── SKILL.md    # frontmatter (name, description, allowed-tools) + instructions
```

Agents see a compact listing (name + description) in their system prompt and load full content on demand via `read_skill`. See `docs/skills.md` for the full specification.

## Database

SQLite database in WAL mode, managed by Drizzle ORM. Key tables:

`projects` · `conversations` · `messages` · `message_parts` · `kanban_tasks` · `agents` · `settings` · `notes` · `channels` · `pull_requests` · `github_issues` · `webhook_configs` · `webhook_events` · `cron_jobs` · `automation_rules` · `audit_log`

Agent sessions (raw SQL, v3 migration): `agent_sessions` · `agent_session_messages`

**Schema changes require a new migration file** in `src/bun/db/migrations/`. Never edit `schema.ts` without adding the corresponding migration.
