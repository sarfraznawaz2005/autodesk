## 1. Overview

AutoDesk is a cross-platform desktop application where AI agent teams autonomously handle the entire software development lifecycle — from planning and coding to execution and delivery. Humans approve plans, deploy, and communicate with agents.

### Core Principles

- **99% agent-driven** — humans approve, deploy, and communicate
- **Restart-safe** — agents always know where they left off via chat history + kanban state
- **Provider-agnostic** — supports Claude, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, and more from day 1
- **Plugin-first** — core functionality extensible via a plugin architecture
- **Production-quality** — each feature ships polished, tested, and reliable

### Target Users

- Solo developers who want AI to handle implementation
- Small teams that need to move fast without a full engineering team
- Tech leads who want AI to handle execution while they focus on architecture
- Non-technical founders who want to build software without hiring developers

### 5.2 AI Provider Integration

**Goal**: Unified multi-provider AI interface using Vercel AI SDK.

- [ ] Provider adapter layer supporting:
  - Anthropic (Claude 3.5/4/4.5/4.6 Sonnet/Opus/Haiku)
  - OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4.5, o1, o3)
  - Z.AI (glm)
  - OpenRouter (any model via OpenRouter API)
  - Ollama (local models)
- [ ] Vercel AI SDK `streamText()` for all providers
- [ ] Vercel AI SDK `useChat()` hook on frontend
- [ ] Tool calling support (provider-native where available, polyfill where not)
- [ ] Streaming support for all providers
- [ ] Token counting and context window management per model
- [ ] Configurable per-agent: provider, model, temperature, max tokens, thinking budget
- [ ] Fallback handling when a provider is unavailable
- [ ] API key rotation/multiple keys per provider

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Switching providers mid-project works without data loss
- Each agent can use a different provider/model
- Streaming works identically regardless of provider
- Token usage is tracked and displayed

### 5.3 Project Manager Agent

**Goal**: The chief agent that orchestrates all work, talks to humans, and spawns sub-agents.

**System Prompt**: Battle-tested prompt (see Section 10) that instructs PM to:
- [ ] Parse human intent (project work vs. general chat)
- [ ] Decide whether to handle directly or spawn sub-agents
- [ ] Respect AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md if present in workspace (injected into system prompt)
- [ ] Follow the Constitution (guardrails)
- [ ] Track work via kanban tasks
- [ ] Provide status updates proactively
- [ ] Resume from where it left off using chat history + kanban state
- [ ] Answer "what were we working on?" by checking current conversation + kanban
- [ ] Create, list, search, and delete projects from chat or channels

**Capabilities**:
- [ ] Spawn up to N concurrent sub-agents (configurable, default 3)
- [ ] Assign non-interdependent tasks to sub-agents
- [ ] Receive results from sub-agents and synthesize
- [ ] Present plans as chat messages for approval
- [ ] Move kanban tasks between columns
- [ ] Create notes/documents
- [ ] Access all built-in tools
- [ ] Create and manage projects via `create_project`, `list_projects`, `search_projects`, `delete_project` tools

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- PM correctly identifies when to spawn agents vs. reply directly
- PM never assigns interdependent tasks to concurrent agents
- PM resumes work correctly after app restart
- PM respects max concurrent agent limit
- PM can create projects from channel messages (Discord, WhatsApp, Email)

### 5.4 Sub-Agent Orchestration

**Goal**: PM spawns specialized agents as separate Vercel AI SDK streams.

- [ ] Each sub-agent gets:
  - Its own AI stream (independent context)
  - Specialized system prompt (from agents table)
  - Constitution appended to system prompt
  - AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md workspace instructions appended to system prompt (same as PM)
  - Subset of tools relevant to its role
  - The specific task assigned by PM
  - Relevant project context (workspace path, kanban state)
- [ ] Sub-agent lifecycle: Spawn -> Work -> Report -> Terminate
- [ ] PM receives structured reports from sub-agents
- [ ] Concurrent execution (up to max_concurrent_agents)
- [ ] Sub-agent errors are caught and reported to PM
- [ ] PM can retry failed sub-agent tasks
- [ ] Workspace instruction files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) loaded with module-level cache; cache invalidated on workflow start

**Agent Communication Protocol**:
- [ ] PM -> Sub-agent: Task assignment with context
- [ ] Sub-agent -> PM: Progress updates, completion reports, error reports
- [ ] Sub-agents CANNOT communicate with each other directly
- [ ] Sub-agents CANNOT spawn other agents

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- 3 sub-agents can run concurrently without interference
- Sub-agent failures don't crash the PM or other agents
- All sub-agent activity is logged and visible in activity pane
- All sub-agents receive the same workspace instructions as the PM

### 5.5 Activity Pane

**Goal**: Real-time feed of all agent activity (right side of chat view).

**Header**:
- [ ] Count of currently spawned agents (e.g., "3 agents active")
- [ ] Agent filter dropdown (show all / filter by specific agent)
- [ ] Tabs: "Activity" | "Docs" (notes/documents created during conversation)

**Activity Feed** (chronological):
- [ ] Agent thinking entries (brain icon, expanded by default, collapsible)
- [ ] Tool call entries (tool-specific icons, collapsed by default, expandable)
- [ ] Tool result entries (nested under tool calls)
- [ ] Kanban task movements (e.g., "Backend Engineer moved 'Setup API' to Working")
- [ ] Sub-agent spawn/terminate events
- [ ] Review verdict events (`review_result` activity type) from code-reviewer verdicts
- [ ] Running indicator (spinner) for in-progress tool calls
- [ ] Agent name + colored avatar on each entry
- [ ] Timestamp on each entry

**Docs Tab**:
- [ ] List of notes/documents created during conversation
- [ ] Click to view in a modal or side panel
- [ ] Markdown rendered

**Resizable**:
- [ ] Divider between main chat and activity pane is draggable
- [ ] Minimum width for both panels

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Activity updates in real-time as agents work
- Filtering by agent correctly shows only that agent's activity
- Thinking blocks are readable and expanded by default
- Tool calls show status (running/complete/error)
- Review verdict results appear in activity feed

### 5.6 Conversation Persistence

**Goal**: All conversations and messages stored in SQLite, restart-safe.

- [ ] `conversations` table: id, project_id, title, is_pinned, created_at, updated_at
- [ ] `messages` table: id, conversation_id, role (human/assistant/system/tool), agent_id, content, metadata (JSON), token_count, created_at
- [ ] `conversation_summaries` table: id, conversation_id, summary_text, messages_summarized_up_to, created_at
- [ ] Plan messages written to messages table with `metadata.isPlan: true` so they survive page reloads
- [ ] Rolling window context management:
  - Keep last N messages in full
  - Summarize older messages via AI call
  - Store summary in conversation_summaries
  - Feed [summary + recent messages] to AI
- [ ] Context window tracking per model (token counting)
- [ ] Auto-compaction triggers when context exceeds 80% of model limit

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Conversations survive app restart
- Switching between conversations is instant
- Context summaries maintain critical project context
- Token usage stays within model limits
- Plan messages reload correctly after page refresh

## 6. Phase 3 — Kanban & Autonomous Workflow

### 6.1 Kanban Board

**Goal**: Interactive kanban with four columns, full drag-and-drop, agent integration.

**Columns**:
- [ ] **Backlog** (gray indicator) — tasks not yet started
- [ ] **Working** (blue indicator) — tasks in progress
- [ ] **Review** (yellow indicator) — tasks awaiting code review
- [ ] **Done** (green indicator) — completed tasks

**Task Cards**:
- [ ] Title
- [ ] Priority indicator (Critical, High, Medium, Low — color-coded)
- [ ] Assigned agent avatar
- [ ] Due date (if set)
- [ ] Blocked indicator (if blocked_by has incomplete tasks)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria progress (e.g., "2/5 criteria met")
- [ ] Click to open task detail modal

**Task Detail Modal**:
- [ ] Title (editable)
- [ ] Description (markdown, editable)
- [ ] Acceptance Criteria — checklist of `[ ]` items (agents and humans can check/uncheck)
- [ ] Important Notes — free-text area agents use for decisions (editable)
- [ ] Priority (Critical / High / Medium / Low)
- [ ] Assigned agent
- [ ] Blocked by (list of task IDs, with links)
- [ ] Due date
- [ ] Created at / Updated at
- [ ] Activity log (who moved it, who edited it, when)

**Interactions**:
- [ ] Drag and drop between columns (dnd-kit)
- [ ] Human moves task Backlog -> Working: PM auto-notified, creates conversation to work on it
- [ ] Human moves task Working -> Backlog: PM stops working on that task
- [ ] Human moves task to Done: PM acknowledges
- [ ] Create task button per column
- [ ] Edit task inline or via modal
- [ ] Delete task with confirmation
- [ ] Search tasks (title, description)
- [ ] Sort tasks within column (priority, date, manual)
- [ ] Filter by assigned agent, priority, blocked status

**Stats Bar** (above kanban or in sidebar):
- [ ] Backlog count with gray indicator
- [ ] Working count with blue indicator
- [ ] Review count with yellow indicator
- [ ] Done count with green indicator
- [ ] Workflow pipeline badge showing current WorkflowEngine state (Planning / Awaiting Approval / Executing / Done)
- [ ] Real-time updates via `workflowStateChanged` RPC broadcast

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Drag and drop is smooth with visual feedback
- Blocked tasks show visual indicator and cannot be moved to Working
- PM reacts correctly to human task movements
- Task state persists across restarts
- Acceptance criteria checkboxes work for both humans and agents
- Stats bar pipeline badge reflects live workflow state

### 6.2 Autonomous Workflow Engine

**Goal**: Implement the standard workflow driven by WorkflowEngine state machine.

**Workflow State Machine**:

```
idle → planning → awaiting_approval → executing → done
                       ^                   ^           |          |
                       |___ rejectPlan ____|           |__ fix ___| (up to maxReviewRounds per task)
                                                                     → failed (if maxTestRounds exceeded)
```

**Workflow Steps**:

```
Step 1: Human sends feature request
Step 2: PM runs task-planner inline (via run_agent)
Step 3: task-planner calls create_note (plan doc in Docs tab)
        task-planner calls define_tasks (structured task definitions stored in WorkflowContext)
Step 4: PM calls request_plan_approval
        → Plan saved as markdown to {workspace}/plans/plan-{timestamp}.md
        → Plan presented as chat message in-app / chunked to channels
        → WorkflowEngine transitions to awaiting_approval
Step 5: Human types "approve" (or approval keyword) in chat
        → Soft approval gate in AgentEngine.sendMessage() detects keyword
        → WorkflowEngine.approvePlan() called immediately (no LLM)
        → Kanban tasks created deterministically from stored task definitions
        → WorkflowEngine transitions to executing
Step 6: WorkflowEngine dispatches agents for unblocked backlog tasks
Step 7: Each worker agent: move_task → working, does work, move_task → review
Step 8: WorkflowEngine auto-spawns code-reviewer per task when it enters review
        → code-reviewer calls submit_review(taskId, verdict, summary)
        → verdict "approved": PM moves task to done
        → verdict "changes_requested": PM dispatches fix agent (up to maxReviewRounds per task)
Step 9: All tasks done → WorkflowEngine transitions to testing
Step 10: qa-engineer runs tests; if pass → done; if fail → re-execute (up to maxTestRounds)
Step 11: PM delivers completion summary to chat + all connected channels
```

**Chat-Based Plan Approval (no modal)**:
- [ ] Plan is presented as a chat message in the conversation (not a modal dialog)
- [ ] Plan message content includes: full plan markdown + instructions ("Reply **approve** to proceed or **reject [feedback]** to request changes")
- [ ] Plan messages are written to the messages DB table and survive page reloads
- [ ] `AgentEngine.sendMessage()` checks for `awaiting_approval` workflow before passing to PM:
  - Approval keywords (`approve`, `approved`, `yes`, `go ahead`, `lgtm`, `looks good`, `go`, `start`, `proceed`) → `WorkflowEngine.approvePlan()` immediately, no LLM call
  - Rejection keywords (`reject`, `no`, `change`, `modify`, `update`, `instead`) → `WorkflowEngine.rejectPlan(feedback)` immediately, no LLM call
  - Ambiguous messages → passed to PM with context that a plan is pending
- [ ] Same mechanism works for in-app chat and all channels (Discord, WhatsApp, Email)

**Skip Approval**:
- [ ] PM can call `request_plan_approval(skip_approval: true)` to bypass the approval gate entirely
- [ ] `WorkflowEngine.startAndExecute()` creates kanban tasks and dispatches agents immediately
- [ ] Use when: workspace already has a README/PRD, user says "just do it", or work is quick/low-risk

**Rejection Flow**:
- [ ] `WorkflowEngine.rejectPlan(workflowId, feedback)` embeds feedback into workflow context
- [ ] task-planner is re-invoked with the feedback; updates plan note and regenerates task definitions
- [ ] Plan re-presented as new chat message; workflow returns to `awaiting_approval`

**Configurable Settings**:
- [ ] Max review/test rounds (default 3, in project settings — `maxReviewRounds` applies per task)
- [ ] Agent plan approval mode (Ask each time / Auto-approve)
- [ ] PM can spawn additional agents (data-engineer, security-engineer, etc.) based on task

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Plan appears as a chat message with approval instructions (no modal)
- Approval keyword in chat triggers WorkflowEngine.approvePlan() without LLM call
- Workflow proceeds automatically after approval
- Code review loop correctly limits retries per task
- Test failure loop correctly limits retries
- PM correctly identifies non-interdependent tasks for parallel execution
- Auto-approve (skip_approval) works end-to-end without human intervention
- Plan files saved to workspace `plans/` directory

### 6.3 Plan Saving to Disk

**Goal**: Plans are persisted as markdown files in the project workspace.

- [ ] `request_plan_approval` saves plan content to `{workspace}/plans/plan-{timestamp}.md`
- [ ] Plans directory created automatically if it does not exist
- [ ] Both approval and skip-approval paths save the plan file
- [ ] Plan files are human-readable markdown for external review

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Plan file exists on disk after `request_plan_approval` is called
- File is valid markdown matching the plan content
- Multiple plans create separate timestamped files without collision

### 6.4 Global Workspace Path & Project Workspaces

**Goal**: Single global workspace setting determines root folder for all projects.

- [ ] Global workspace path stored in `settings` table under key `global_workspace_path`
- [ ] Configured during onboarding (Step 5) or in Settings > General
- [ ] New project creation auto-derives workspace path: `{globalWorkspace}/{slugified-name}`
  - Slug: lowercase, alphanumeric + hyphens, no leading/trailing hyphens
  - Collision handling: append numeric suffix (`-1`, `-2`, etc.)
- [ ] User can manually override the path in the project creation modal
- [ ] PM's `create_project` tool uses the global workspace path for channel-created projects

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Projects created in-app and via channels get auto-derived workspace paths
- Name collisions are handled without error
- Workspace path is a valid filesystem path under the global workspace root

### 6.5 Agent Tools System

**Goal**: Built-in tools that agents use to work autonomously on projects.

**File Operations**:
- [ ] `read_file` — read file contents (with line range support)
- [ ] `write_file` — create or overwrite a file
- [ ] `edit_file` — surgical string replacement in a file
- [ ] `list_directory` — list files/folders in a path
- [ ] `search_files` — glob pattern file search
- [ ] `search_content` — grep/regex content search across files
- [ ] `delete_file` — delete a file (with safety checks)
- [ ] `move_file` — move or rename a file

**Shell Operations**:
- [ ] `run_shell` — execute shell commands with stdout/stderr capture
- [ ] Approval modes: Ask each / Auto-approve / Allowlist
- [ ] Blocked command patterns (rm -rf /, format, etc.)
- [ ] Configurable timeout (default 120s)
- [ ] Working directory scoped to project workspace

**Kanban Operations**:

## 10. Agent Definitions

### Project Manager

**Internal Name**: `project-manager`
**Display Name**: Project Manager
**Role**: Chief orchestrator. Talks to humans, spawns sub-agents, manages workflow. Can create and manage projects from chat and channels.

**Default System Prompt** (summary):
```
You are the Project Manager agent for AutoDesk AI.

ROLE:
- Primary point of contact between the human and all sub-agents
- Orchestrate the entire development workflow
- Make decisions about which agents to spawn and when
- Maintain project state via kanban tasks
- Create and manage projects when requested

WORKFLOW:
1. Analyze human requests carefully
2. For complex tasks:
   - Delegate to task-planner (who calls create_note + define_tasks)
   - Call request_plan_approval — plan is presented as a chat message
   - Wait for "approve" keyword in chat (or set skip_approval: true)
   - After approval, kanban tasks are created automatically
   - Worker agents dispatch and report back
3. For simple tasks: handle directly or spawn a single agent
4. Always ensure tasks assigned to concurrent agents are NOT interdependent
5. After agent work: code-reviewer runs per task (via submit_review)
   → pass: PM moves to done; fail: PM sends back (max maxReviewRounds per task)
   → after all tasks: qa-engineer tests

RESTART SAFETY:
- When asked "what were we working on?", check conversation history AND kanban tasks
- Always be able to resume from where you left off

COMMUNICATION:
- Be concise and professional
- Proactively update humans on progress
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous

CONSTITUTION:
{constitution}

WORKSPACE INSTRUCTIONS:
If the workspace contains AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md, their contents are injected
automatically into the system prompt and MUST be followed.
```

## 13. Default Constitution

```markdown
## AutoDesk Agent Constitution

### Safety
- NEVER execute destructive commands (rm -rf /, format, drop database) without explicit human approval
- NEVER access files outside the project workspace directory
- NEVER expose API keys, secrets, or credentials in code, logs, or chat
- NEVER make network requests to unknown or unauthorized endpoints
- NEVER modify system files or configurations outside the project

### Code Quality
- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions
- Write code that is readable, maintainable, and well-structured
- Include error handling for all external operations (I/O, network, parsing)
- Do not introduce known security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones

### Communication
- Be honest about limitations and uncertainties
- Report errors and failures immediately to PM
- Ask for clarification rather than making risky assumptions
- Provide concise, actionable status updates

### Autonomy Boundaries
- Agents may read any file in the workspace
- Agents may write/edit files in the workspace
- Agents must request approval for shell commands (unless auto-approve is on)
- Agents must NEVER push to remote without human approval (even with auto-approve)
- Agents must NEVER deploy to production without human approval
- Agents must follow the approved plan — deviations require PM approval

### Resource Limits
- Respect token budgets and context limits
- Do not create unnecessary files or bloat the codebase
- Clean up temporary files after use
```

---

## 14. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- App cold start: <50ms (Electrobun target)
- SQLite query response: <10ms for common queries
- Chat message streaming: first token visible within 500ms of send
- Kanban drag-and-drop: 60fps animation
- Activity pane updates: <100ms latency

### Reliability
- SQLite WAL mode prevents corruption on crash
- All agent state persisted to DB (restart-safe)
- Workflow state persisted to `settings` table under `workflow:<conversationId>` for crash recovery
- Graceful error handling — no unhandled exceptions crash the app
- Agent failures isolated (one agent crash doesn't affect others)

### Security
- API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256 or platform keychain)
- Shell commands sandboxed to workspace directory
- Plugin execution sandboxed
- No remote code execution vulnerabilities

### Usability
- Light theme only (clean, professional)
- Responsive layout (minimum 1024x768)
- Keyboard navigable (a11y)
- All destructive actions require confirmation
- Loading states for all async operations

### Testing
- Unit tests for all business logic (database, agent orchestration, tools)
- Integration tests for RPC bridge
- Component tests for critical UI components
- E2E tests for core workflows (create project, chat, kanban)

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode
- ESLint + Prettier enforced
- Modular architecture (clear separation of concerns)
- KISS, DRY, SOLID principles
- Reusable components

- Natural language schedule parsing ("remind me every morning at 9am")
- Task types:
  - PM agent prompt (send a message to PM as if human typed it)
  - Reminder (notification to human)
  - Shell command (run a script)
  - Webhook (call an external URL)
  - Agent task (spawn an agent to do something)
- Missed task recovery on app restart (recalculate, run if overdue)
- Task execution history with logs
- Enable/disable individual tasks
- One-time scheduled tasks (run once at specific datetime, then auto-disable)
- Timezone-aware scheduling
