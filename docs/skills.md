# Skills System — AutoDesk AI

> Definitive spec for the skills system. Read this before touching any skills-related code.

---

## Overview

Skills extend what AutoDesk AI agents can do. A skill is a directory containing a
`SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter (metadata) and markdown instructions.

Skills use a **compact prompt injection** approach to save tokens: only skill
names and one-line descriptions are injected into agent system prompts. Agents
decide for themselves whether a skill is relevant to their task, and load full
skill content on demand using the `read_skill` tool. They can also search for
skills by keyword using `find_skills`.

Skills are **filesystem-only** — they are never stored in the database. The app
discovers skills from a well-known directory on startup. Users create and edit
skills outside the app using their OS file editor. The UI provides a read-only
Skills page for browsing discovered skills and a button to open the skills folder
in the OS file explorer.

The skill format is **compatible with the Claude Code / Agent Skills open standard**.
Skills created for Claude Code work in AutoDesk AI and vice versa.

## Skills Directories

Skills are loaded from two directories:

### 1. Built-in Skills (read-only, shipped with app)

```
Resources/app/skills/     (in the app bundle)
```

Source: `skills/` in the project root. Copied into the bundle via
`electrobun.config.ts` → `build.copy: { "skills": "skills" }`. At runtime,
resolved via `import.meta.dir` (same pattern as bundled plugins).

### 2. User Skills (read-write)

```
{userData}/skills/
```

Concrete path (Windows): `C:\Users\{user}\AppData\Local\com.sarfrazai.autodesk\dev\skills\`

Resolved via `Utils.paths.userData` + `/skills/`. Created automatically on first
startup if it doesn't exist. The `openSkillsFolder` RPC also ensures the
directory exists before opening it.

### Load Order

Built-in skills load first, then user skills. If a user skill has the same name
as a built-in skill, the user skill **overrides** it. This lets users customize
or replace built-in skills without modifying the app bundle.

Each skill is a subdirectory containing `SKILL.md` as the required entrypoint:

```
skills/
├── explain-code/
│   ├── SKILL.md              # Required — frontmatter + instructions
│   ├── reference.md          # Optional supporting file
│   ├── examples/
│   │   └── sample.md         # Optional example output
│   └── scripts/
│       └── validate.sh       # Optional script the agent can execute
├── api-conventions/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── deploy/
    ├── SKILL.md
    └── scripts/
        └── deploy.sh
```

---

## SKILL.md Format

### Frontmatter (YAML)

All fields are optional. Only `description` is recommended.

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it
allowed-tools: read_file, search_files, run_shell
argument-hint: "[issue-number]"
agent: frontend_engineer
---
```

| Field                      | Type    | Default         | Description |
|----------------------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| `name`                     | string  | directory name  | Display name. Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens only (max 64 chars). |
| `description`              | string  | first paragraph | What the skill does. Agents see this in their compact listing. **Recommended.** |
| `allowed-tools`            | string  | (none)          | Comma-separated tool names the skill references (informational — shown in UI). |
| `argument-hint`            | string  | (none)          | Hint for expected arguments, e.g. `[issue-number]`. Shown in UI. |
| `agent`                    | string  | (none)          | Preferred agent role (e.g. `frontend_engineer`, `backend-engineer`). Informational — shown in listings. |

> **Removed fields**: `disable-model-invocation` and `user-invocable` are no
> longer used. All discovered skills are loaded and visible to all agents. The
> LLM decides relevance itself.

### Markdown Body

Everything after the closing `---` is the skill's instruction content. Agents
load this on demand via the `read_skill` tool.

#### String Substitutions

| Variable                | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `$ARGUMENTS`            | All arguments passed when invoking the skill. |
| `$ARGUMENTS[N]`         | Specific argument by 0-based index. |
| `$N`                    | Shorthand for `$ARGUMENTS[N]` (e.g. `$0`, `$1`). |
| `${AUTODESK_SKILL_DIR}` | Absolute path to the skill's directory. Use to reference bundled scripts/files. |

#### Dynamic Context Injection

The `` !`command` `` syntax runs a shell command **before** the skill content is
sent to the agent. The command output replaces the placeholder.

```markdown
## Current git status
!`git status --short`

## Recent commits
!`git log --oneline -5`
```

This is **preprocessing** — agents never see the commands, only the output.

### Supporting Files

Additional files in the skill directory are not loaded automatically. Reference
them from `SKILL.md` so agents know what's available:

```markdown
## Additional resources
- For complete API details, see [reference.md](reference.md)
- For usage examples, see [examples.md](examples.md)
- To run validation: `bash ${AUTODESK_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/validate.sh`
```

Agents can read these files using their `read_file` tool when needed.

---

## Discovery & Loading

### When Discovery Happens

Skills are discovered **once on app startup**. The app scans the skills directory,
parses all `SKILL.md` files, and builds an in-memory registry. Users can also
trigger a manual refresh from the Skills page UI.

There is no file watcher — changes to skills require an app restart or manual
refresh from the UI.

### Discovery Process

1. Scan `{userData}/skills/` for subdirectories containing `SKILL.md`
2. Parse YAML frontmatter from each `SKILL.md`
3. Extract markdown body (everything after frontmatter)
4. Resolve skill name: frontmatter `name` field, or directory name as fallback
5. List supporting files (other files in the skill directory)
6. Store in `SkillRegistry` (in-memory `Map<name, Skill>`)

**All discovered skills are loaded — there is no enabled/disabled toggle.**

### Skill Object Shape

```typescript
interface Skill {
  name: string;                    // e.g. "explain-code"
  description: string;             // from frontmatter or first paragraph
  dirPath: string;                 // absolute path to skill directory
  filePath: string;                // absolute path to SKILL.md
  content: string;                 // raw markdown body (without frontmatter)
  allowedTools: string[];          // e.g. ["Read", "Grep"]
  argumentHint?: string;           // e.g. "[issue-number]"
  preferredAgent?: string;         // e.g. "frontend_engineer"
  supportingFiles: string[];       // relative paths of other files in skill dir
}
```

## Agent Integration — Compact Mode

### Design Rationale

To save tokens, we do NOT inject full skill content into system prompts. Instead
we use a **compact mode**: only skill names and one-line descriptions are listed.
Agents decide for themselves whether a skill is relevant and load content on
demand. This keeps prompts lean even with many installed skills.

### How Agents Discover Skills

A compact "Available Skills" section is appended to every agent's system prompt:

```
## Available Skills

The following skills are installed. Use `read_skill` to load a skill's full
instructions when relevant. Use `find_skills` to search for skills by keyword.

- **explain-code**: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies
- **api-conventions**: API design patterns for this codebase
- **react-best-practices**: React 19 patterns, hooks rules, optimization [agent: frontend_engineer]
```

This section is **always present** for all agents (PM and sub-agents). All
discovered skills are listed — there is no filtering.

### How Agents Use Skills

Agents have two skill tools available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `read_skill` | Loads the full content of a skill by exact name. Returns the resolved SKILL.md body (after substitutions and bash injections). Agents call this when they determine a skill is relevant to their current task. |
| `find_skills` | Searches skill names and descriptions by keyword query. Returns matching skill summaries. Agents use this when they need to discover skills beyond the compact listing (e.g. searching for a concept). |

**The LLM decides relevance** — no auto-matching or keyword overlap scoring is
performed by the engine. The system prompt tells agents about the tools and the
agent decides when to use them.

### Prompt Injection Wording

The skills section in the system prompt includes guidance:

```
## Available Skills

The following skills are installed and can provide specialized instructions for
your tasks. When a skill looks relevant to your current work:
1. Call `read_skill` with the skill name to load its full instructions
2. Follow the loaded instructions for the task at hand
Use `find_skills` with a keyword if you need to search for skills.

- **skill-name**: one-line description
...
```

### No _activeSkill or Auto-matching

The previous approach of `_activeSkill` in the engine and keyword-based
`matchForAgent()` auto-matching is removed. Skills are purely agent-driven:
compact listing in prompt → agent decides → `read_skill` on demand.

---

## Content Resolution Pipeline

When `read_skill` is called, the content goes through a resolution pipeline:

1. **Retrieve** — Look up skill by name in the registry
2. **Bash injection** — Execute all `` !`command` `` blocks and replace with output
3. **Argument substitution** — Replace `$ARGUMENTS`, `$0`, `$1`, `${AUTODESK_SKILL_DIR}`
4. **Return** — Full resolved content returned as tool result

---

## Agent Tools

### `read_skill`

Available to all agents (PM and sub-agents).

**Parameters:**
- `name` (string, required) — Exact skill name as listed in Available Skills

**Returns:** Full resolved skill content (markdown body with substitutions applied)

**Error:** Returns error message with list of available skill names if not found.

### `find_skills`

Available to all agents (PM and sub-agents).

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required) — Search keyword(s)

**Returns:** Array of matching skills with name and description. Matches against
skill names and descriptions (case-insensitive substring match).

---

## UI — Skills Page

The Skills page is **read-only**. It shows discovered skills and provides
utilities for managing the skills directory.

### Layout

- **Header**: "Skills" title + skill count + search/filter input + "Refresh" button + "Open Skills Folder" button
- **Info banner**: Brief guide on skill format, `read_skill` usage, and inline "click here" link to Available Tools Reference dialog
- **Available Tools Reference**: Dialog listing all agent tools grouped by category — helps users know valid names for the `allowed-tools` frontmatter field
- **Skills grid**: 2-column card grid. Each card has:
  - **Header bar** (gray, matching project card style): skill name + preferred agent badge + edit (pencil) icon button
  - **Body**: description, supporting files count, argument hint
  - Click card body → opens **Skill Detail Dialog**
- **Skill Detail Dialog**: Shows skill name, agent badge, description, tools (with semi-bold names), and full SKILL.md content rendered as formatted markdown
- **Empty state**: Guidance message + "Open Skills Folder" button

### User Actions

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Browse skills | Skills page (2-column grid) |
| View skill content | Click card → detail dialog with rendered markdown |
| Filter skills | Type in search input (header, partial + case-insensitive match) |
| View available tools | Click "click here" link in info banner → tools reference dialog |
| Create a skill | Open skills folder in OS, create directory + SKILL.md |
| Edit a skill | Click pencil icon on skill card header — opens SKILL.md in OS default editor |
| Delete a skill | Open skills folder in OS, delete the directory |
| Refresh discovery | Click "Refresh" button on Skills page — re-reads skills folder |

## RPC Layer

### Contract (`src/shared/rpc/skills.ts`)

```typescript
skills: {
  getSkills: { params: {}; response: SkillSummary[] };
  getSkill: { params: { name: string }; response: SkillDetail | null };
  refreshSkills: { params: {}; response: { count: number } };
  getSkillsDirectory: { params: {}; response: { path: string } };
  openSkillInEditor: { params: { name: string }; response: { success: boolean } };
  openSkillsFolder: { params: {}; response: { success: boolean } };
  getAvailableTools: { params: {}; response: Array<{ name: string; category: string; description: string }> };
}
```

### Handlers (`src/bun/rpc/skills.ts`)

- `getSkills()` — returns all skills from registry (summary: name, description, metadata)
- `getSkill(name)` — returns full detail including content and supporting files
- `refreshSkills()` — triggers `registry.reload()`, returns new count
- `getSkillsDirectory()` — returns the skills directory absolute path
- `openSkillInEditor(name)` — opens the skill's SKILL.md in the OS default editor
- `openSkillsFolder()` — ensures directory exists (mkdirSync), opens in OS explorer
- `getAvailableTools()` — returns all agent tool definitions (name, category, description) for the UI reference dialog

agent: frontend_engineer
allowed-tools: read_file, search_files, search_content

# React 19 Best Practices

When writing React components in this codebase:

## Component Patterns
- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Prefer `use` hook for data fetching (React 19)
- Use `useOptimistic` for optimistic UI updates
- Memoize with `useMemo`/`useCallback` only when profiling shows a need

## State Management
- Local state: `useState` / `useReducer`
- Global state: Zustand stores (see src/mainview/stores/)
- Server state: React Query or `use` hook

## File Organization
- One component per file
- Co-locate styles, tests, and types with components
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) for public APIs only

## For detailed API reference, see:
- [hooks-reference.md](hooks-reference.md)
- [performance-checklist.md](performance-checklist.md)
```
